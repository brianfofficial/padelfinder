# What is Padel? A Complete Guide to the Fastest-Growing Sport

Padel (pronounced "pah-DEL") is a racquet sport that has taken the world by storm. Combining elements of tennis, squash, and racquetball, padel is played on an enclosed court about one-third the size of a tennis court. It's always played in doubles, making it inherently social and accessible to players of all skill levels.

## How Padel Works

Padel is played on a 20m x 10m enclosed court with glass walls and metallic mesh fencing. The court features a net similar to tennis, but lower. Players use solid, stringless paddles (rather than strung racquets) and a depressurized tennis ball.

### Key Rules

- **Always doubles**: Padel is exclusively a doubles game (2v2)
- **Underhand serve**: Serves must be hit underhand, below waist height
- **Walls are in play**: Like squash, the ball can bounce off the glass walls and still be returned
- **One bounce rule**: The ball must bounce once on the ground before hitting a wall
- **Scoring**: Uses the same scoring system as tennis (15, 30, 40, deuce, advantage)

## Why Padel is Perfect for Beginners

Unlike tennis, padel has a much shorter learning curve. The smaller court means less running, the underhand serve eliminates the difficult overhead motion, and the enclosed walls keep the ball in play longer, leading to more rallies and more fun from day one.

Most beginners can enjoy a competitive game within their first hour of play.

## Equipment You Need

- **Padel racket**: Solid, perforated paddle (no strings). Prices range from $50-$300
- **Padel balls**: Similar to tennis balls but with slightly less pressure
- **Court shoes**: Any indoor court or tennis shoe with good lateral support
- **Comfortable athletic clothing**: No special attire required

The US padel scene is experiencing explosive growth. From roughly 180 courts in 2020, the country now has over 400 dedicated padel courts, with new facilities opening monthly. Major cities like Miami, New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Chicago are leading the charge.

The sport is particularly popular in areas with large Hispanic and European populations, where padel has been a mainstream sport for decades.
