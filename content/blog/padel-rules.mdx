# Padel Rules: A Simple Guide for Beginners

New to padel? This guide covers everything you need to know to step on the court with confidence. Padel rules are straightforward, especially if you're familiar with tennis.

## The Basics

- Padel is **always played in doubles** (2 vs 2)
- Games use **tennis-style scoring**: 15, 30, 40, deuce, advantage
- A set is won by the first team to win **6 games** (with a tiebreak at 6-6)
- Matches are typically **best of 3 sets**

## The Serve

The serve is one of the biggest differences from tennis:

1. The server must **bounce the ball** on the ground first
2. Hit the ball **at or below waist height**
3. Serve **underhand** (no overhead serves allowed)
4. Serve diagonally into the **opposite service box**
5. The ball must bounce in the service box before hitting the glass wall
6. You get **two serve attempts** (like tennis)
7. Servers alternate service games, and partners alternate serves within a game

## Walls in Play

This is what makes padel unique:

- After the ball bounces on the **ground**, it can hit any wall and still be returned
- You can play the ball **off your own back wall** — a key tactical element
- The ball must **always bounce on the ground first** before hitting a wall
- If the ball hits the **mesh/fence** directly (without bouncing), it's out
- You **cannot** volley the ball into the walls — the ball must bounce first

## Scoring

Padel uses identical scoring to tennis:

- **Points**: 0 (love), 15, 30, 40
- **Deuce**: When both teams reach 40
- **Advantage**: The team that wins the next point after deuce
- **Game**: Won by scoring advantage, or by 2 points in a tiebreak
- **Set**: First to 6 games (must win by 2; tiebreak at 6-6)
- **Match**: Best of 3 sets

## Key Rules to Remember

### In Play
- The ball can bounce **once** on the ground before being returned
- Players can hit the ball **before it bounces** (volley), except on serve return
- After the ground bounce, the ball can touch **walls, glass, or mesh** and still be in play

### Out of Play
- The ball bounces **twice** on the ground
- The ball goes **over the back wall or mesh** without bouncing on the opponent's side first
- The ball hits a player
- The ball hits the **net** and doesn't go over

### The Net
- Players **cannot touch** the net or posts
- The ball must go **over the net** (not around or under)
- If the ball hits the net cord and goes over during a rally, play continues

## Winning Strategy Tips

1. **Control the net**: Like doubles tennis, the net position is dominant
2. **Use the walls**: Lob shots off the back glass are a signature padel move
3. **Be patient**: Longer rallies are normal — wait for opportunities
4. **Communicate**: Talk to your partner about positioning and shot selection
5. **Practice the bandeja**: This overhead defensive shot is essential at intermediate+ levels
