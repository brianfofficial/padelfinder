# Padel vs Pickleball: Key Differences Explained

Both padel and pickleball are among the fastest-growing sports in the United States, but they're very different games. Here's a comprehensive comparison to help you understand each sport.

## Court Comparison

| Feature | Padel | Pickleball |
|---------|-------|------------|
| Court size | 20m × 10m (66' × 33') | 13.4m × 6.1m (44' × 20') |
| Walls | Glass walls + mesh (enclosed) | No walls (open) |
| Net height | 88cm (34.6") center | 86cm (34") center |
| Surface | Artificial grass, concrete, or carpet | Hard court |
| Players | Doubles only (2v2) | Singles or doubles |

## Equipment

**Padel** uses a solid, perforated paddle (no strings) and a depressurized tennis ball. Rackets are tear-drop shaped and typically 45-46cm long.

**Pickleball** uses a solid paddle (wood, composite, or graphite) and a perforated polymer ball (wiffle-style). Paddles are smaller and lighter than padel rackets.

## Gameplay Differences

### Serving
- **Padel**: Underhand serve, must bounce first then be hit below waist
- **Pickleball**: Underhand serve, hit out of the air or after a bounce

### Walls
The biggest difference: padel courts have glass walls and mesh that are in play. After the ball bounces on the ground, it can hit the walls and still be returned. This creates longer rallies and exciting angles. Pickleball is played on an open court with no walls.

### Scoring
- **Padel**: Tennis-style scoring (15, 30, 40, deuce)
- **Pickleball**: Rally scoring to 11 (or 15/21), win by 2

### Athleticism
Padel generally requires more athleticism due to the larger court and faster ball speed. Pickleball is more accessible for older players and those with limited mobility.

## Which Should You Try?

**Choose padel if you:**
- Enjoy tennis or squash
- Want a more athletic, fast-paced game
- Like the social aspect of doubles play
- Want to try something truly unique

**Choose pickleball if you:**
- Want maximum accessibility
- Prefer playing singles sometimes
- Have limited mobility concerns
- Want the widest selection of courts

## The Best Answer: Try Both!

Both sports are incredibly fun and social. Many players enjoy both. The great news is that both are growing rapidly in the US, making courts increasingly easy to find.
